ChangeLog for package dwdst

v1.0.2 Mon, 25 Aug 2003 04:04:44 +0200
  + added dwdstHMMTrainer class and executable 'dwdstrain'
	- names may change to speed things up for fully supervised training
	  with kmax=3
	- Even this API still needs some way to handle unknown tokens for
	  n-gram generation...
  + added namespace 'dwdst', shoved everything I could into it
	- still global: flex++/bison++ lexers/parsers
	  * couldn't get namespaces to work with these - got
	    alleged conflicts with stdio.h
  + wrote many docs
  + STILL todo:
	- missing a decent string API for dwdstCHMM ...
	- get GenGetopt::cmdline_[ch] to stop complaining about
	  command-lines overriding config-files...


v1.0.1 Sun, 24 Aug 2003 00:37:25 +0200
  + (dwdstCHMM::TagMorphMap)s now handled as pointers, analysis-sets
    are stored with corresponding tags in the state-table
  + Added top-level interface structure (dwdstHMM::ViterbiPathNode*)
  + Still missing:
	- string-set interface to dwdstCHMM::viterbi_step()
	- *HMM::can_flush() , *HMM::viterbi_flush()
	  ~ ought to be easy to implement
	
v1.0.0 Thu, 21 Aug 2003 13:37:21 +0200
  + new class for morphological analysis: 'dwdstMorph'
  + new user program for morphology only: 'dwdsm' (replaces old 'dwdst')
  + new class for morphologically-aware disambiguation: 'dwdstCHMM'
  + re-wrote 'dwdst': now uses 'dwdstCHMM' as base class
  + wrote binary load/save routines for 'dwdstHMM', 'dwdstCHMM'
  + added tag-extraction hook-FST to 'dwdstMorph'
	- just using an identity-FST slows us down ca. 50%
	- maybe fixing a libFSM bug preventing FSA->compose(FST)
	  would help here...
  + tried new morphology, with abominable (accuracy=70%) results
  + TODO:
	- fix new morphology (argh)
	- enable pre-computed tagsets in input files in dwdstCHMM
	  as for dwdstHMM (parse dwdsm "TAG:ANALYSIS" format?!)
	  * looks like a job for POSIX regexes...
	- write perl-XS interface
	
v1.0.0_pre4 Thu, 14 Aug 2003 17:55:48 +0200
  + corrected '-q' syntax for dwdst, optimized 
    dwdstTagger::symbol_vector_to_string_dq() method.
  + added class 'dwdstHMM' for HMM-style tagging/disambiguation
	
Wed Nov 13 16:02:33 CET 2002
  + updated for FSMlib v0.1.0
