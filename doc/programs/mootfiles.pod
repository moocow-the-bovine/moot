## Program Configuration Files
=pod

=head1 PROGRAM CONFIGURATION FILES

Most moot utility programs support global and user-specific
configuration files which can be used to set system defaults
and/or user preferences for values of program options.

Configuration files are expected to contain lines of the form:

 LONG_OPTION_NAME    OPTION_VALUE

where LONG_OPTION_NAME is the long name of one of the
program's options, without the leading '--', and
OPTION_VALUE is the value for that option, if any.
Fields are whitespace-separated.
Blank lines and comments (lines beginning with a '#' character)
are ignored.

The following configuration files are read by default,
where ${PROGNAME} is the name of a moot utility program,
and ${HOME} is the home directory of the current user:

=over 4

=item /etc/${PROGNAME}rc

System defaults file; read first.

=item ${HOME}/.${PROGNAME}rc

User preferences file, can be used to override system defaults.

=back

Any options specified on the command-line override
defaults from a program configuration file.

## Input: Text: Raw Text files
=pod

=head2 Raw Text Files

A "raw" text file is just that: any file consiting of (8-bit)
characters.  Such files may be processed by the L<mootpp>
preprocessor to produce "rare cooked" (-tagged, -analyzed)
text files.  An example "raw" text file is:

 This is a test.  This too.

## Input: Cooked Text Files
=pod

=head2 Cooked Text Files

A "cooked" text file is a text file which encodes information
such as token boundaries, sentence boundaries, part-of-speech tag,
and/or potential analyses.  The moot utilities distinguish between
several different types of cooked text file: in order of ascending
informational content, these are:
"rare" (-tagged, -analyzed),
"medium rare" (-tagged, +analyzed),
"medium" (+tagged, -analyzed),
"well done" (+tagged, +analyzed),
and
"refried" (+tagged, +analyzed, +evaluated).
Differnent moot utilities require their input files to be
more or less "cooked" -- see the documentation of the individual
utilities for details.

Native "cooked" text files are conventionally
identified by the filename infix ".moot".

=over 4

=cut

##--------------------------------------------------------------
## Input: Cooked: Rare (-tagged,-analyzed)
=pod

=item Rare

=item (-tagged, -analyzed)

=item Files: *.t, *.r, *.rt

The most basic level of "cookedness", a "rare" text file encodes
only token- and sentence-boundaries.
By convention, "rare"
filenames carry the extension ".t".  The syntax is:

 RARE_FILE  ::= {RARE_LINE}*
 RARE_LINE  ::= ({COMMENT} | {EOS} | {RARE_TOKEN}) {NEWLINE}
 COMMENT    ::= {SPACE}* "%%" ([^{NEWLINE}])*
 EOS        ::= ( {SPACE}* {NEWLINE} )+
 RARE_TOKEN ::= {TOKEN_TEXT}
 TOKEN_TEXT ::= ( {WORDCHAR} | {SPACE} )+
 SPACE      ::= " "
 NEWLINE    ::= "\n" | "\r"
 WORDCHAR   ::= [^{SPACE}{NEWLINE}]

Leading and trailing spaces are stripped from token text; it is
thus impossible to declare an "empty" token.  An example
"rare cooked" file is:

 %% Example rare cooked file for moot
 %% Sentence 1
 This
 is
 a
 test
 .
 
 %% Sentence 2
 This
 too
 .

=cut

##--------------------------------------------------------------
## Input: Cooked: Medium Rare (-tagged,+analyzed)
=pod

=item Medium Rare

=item (-tagged, +analyzed)

=item Files: *.mr, *.mrt

A "medium rare" file is at least as informative as a "rare"
file -- that is, it encodes everything that a "rare" file
encodes, and in exactly the same fashion.  Additionally,
a "medium rare" file may contain for each token a set
of (TAB-separated) possible I<analyses> for that token, where
an "analysis" contains at least a part-of-speech tag, and possibly
also a numeric cost and arbitrary analysis details.
Somewhat counter-intuitively,
every "rare" file is also a "medium rare" file for which
every token is associated with an empty set of possible analyses.
By convention, "medium rare" filenames carry the extension ".mrt"

 MED_RARE_FILE  ::= {MED_RARE_LINE}*
 MED_RARE_LINE  ::= ({COMMENT} | {EOS} | {MED_RARE_TOKEN}) {NEWLINE}
 MED_RARE_TOKEN ::= {TOKEN_TEXT} ( {TAB} {ANALYSIS} )*
 ANALYSIS       ::= {DETAIL_PREFIX}? {TAG} {DETAIL_SUFFIX}?
 DETAIL_PREFIX  ::= ( {WORDCHAR} | {SPACE} | {COST} )* ("[" ("_"?))?
 COST           ::= "<" ("-"|"+")? ([0-9]* ".")? [0-9]+ ">"
 TAG            ::= {TAGCHAR}+
 DETAIL_SUFFIX  ::= ( {WORDCHAR} | {SPACE} | {COST} )*
 TAGCHAR        ::= [^{SPACE}{TAB}{NEWLINE}"]"]
 TAB            ::= "\t"

Leading and trailing spaces are stripped from token text,
as well as from analysis-detail and -tag text.  It should
be noted that the I<TAG> component of each I<ANALYSIS>
is "greedy" -- if an
analysis contains no left-bracket to mark the beginning
of a tag, then the whole analysis (up to the first right-bracket
or space) is considered the tag.  Also, if the analysis
contains multiple left-brackets, only the I<first> is
considered to introduce the I<TAG> component.
An example "medium rare" file is:

 %% Example medium-rare cooked file for moot
 %% Sentence 1 : possible analyses are tags only
 This   NE      PDAT    PDIS
 is     VAFIN   VVFIN
 a      ART     CARD
 test   NN      VVIN
 .      $.
 
 %% Sentence 2 : detailed analyses, with unknown word "foo".
 This   This [NE type="name"] <420>      <24.7> this [_PDAT][_sg]
 foo
 .      . [$.] <-42>

Tokens in "medium rare" files with empty analysis sets
(i.e. I<RARE_TOKEN>s)
are called "unrecognized" tokens.

=cut

##--------------------------------------------------------------
## Input: Cooked: Medium (+tagged,-analyzed)
=pod

=item Medium

=item (+tagged, -analyzed)

=item Files: *.tt, *.ttt, *.m, *.mt

A "medium" file can be understood as a "medium rare" file which
associates exactly one analysis with each token.  The tag for this
analysis is considered the "best" tag for the associated token.
By convention, "medium" filenames carry the extension ".tt"
(tagger output) or ".ttt" (gold standard).

 MEDIUM_FILE    ::= {MEDIUM_LINE}*
 MEDIUM_LINE    ::= ({COMMENT} | {EOS} | {MEDIUM_TOKEN}) {NEWLINE}
 MEDIUM_TOKEN   ::= {TOKEN_TEXT} {TAB} {BEST_ANALYSIS}
 BEST_ANALYSIS  ::= {ANALYSIS}

As before, leading and trailing spaces are stripped from
token text and analyses, and the I<TAG> component of each
I<ANALYSIS> is "greedy".
An example "medium" file is:

 %% Example medium cooked file for moot
 %% Sentence 1 : best analyses are tags only
 This   PDAT
 is     VVFIN
 a      ART
 test   NN
 .      $.

 .      <-42> . [$.]

=cut

##--------------------------------------------------------------
## Input: Cooked: Well Done (+tagged,+analyzed)
=pod

=item Well Done

=item (+tagged, +analyzed)

=item Files: *.wd, *.wdt

A "well done" file can be understood as the synthesis of
a "medium rare" and a "medium" file: it contains a "best"
analysis for each token (the first one), as well as a set of
I<a priori> potential analyses analyses for that token.
By convention, "well done" filenames carry the extension ".wd"
(tagger output) or ".wdt" (gold standard).

 WELL_DONE_FILE  ::= {WELL_DONE_LINE}*
 WELL_DONE_LINE  ::= ({COMMENT} | {EOS} | {WELL_DONE_TOKEN}) {NEWLINE}
 WELL_DONE_TOKEN ::= {TOKEN_TEXT} {TAB} {BEST_ANALYSIS} ( {TAB} {ANALYSIS} )*

As before, leading and trailing spaces are stripped from
token text and analyses, and the I<TAG> component of each
I<ANALYSIS> is "greedy".
An example "well done" file is:

 %% Example well-done cooked file for moot
 %% Sentence 1 : analysis-set tags bracketed for clarity

##--------------------------------------------------------------
## Input: Cooked: Refried (+eval,(+tagged,+/-analyzed)^2)
=pod

=item Refried

=item (+tagged, +analyzed, +evaluated)

A "refried" file is basically the synthesis of a pair of
"medium" or "well done" files.  "Refried" files can be
created by the F<mooteval> program from a pair of
parallel cooked files.  Each line of a "refried" file
contains an status code, and a pair of "well-done" style token
analyses separated by tabs and a single slash '/'.

 REFRIED_FILE     ::= {REFRIED_LINE}*
 REFRIED_LINE     ::= ( {COMMENT} | {EOS} | {REFRIED_TOKEN} ) {NEWLINE}
 REFRIED_TOKEN    ::= {STATUS_CODE} {TAB} {REFRIED_SOURCES}
 REFRIED_SOURCES  ::= {WELL_DONE_TOKEN} {TAB} "/" {TAB} {WELL_DONE_TOKEN}
 STATUS_CODE      ::= {BASIC_FLAGS} ":" {FILE1_FLAGS} ":" {FILE2_FLAGS}
 BASIC_FLAGS      ::= {TOKMATCH_FLAG} {BESTMATCH_FLAG}
 TOKMATCH_FLAG    ::= "-" | "t"
 BESTMATCH_FLAG   ::= "-" | "b"
 FILE1_FLAGS      ::= {FILE_FLAGS}
 FILE2_FLAGS      ::= {FILE_FLAGS}
 FILE_FLAGS       ::= {EMPTY_FLAG} {IMPOSSIBLE_FLAG} {XIMPOSSIBLE_FLAG}
 EMPTY_FLAG       ::= "-" | "e"
 IMPOSSIBLE_FLAG  ::= "-" | "i"
 XIMPOSSIBLE_FLAG ::= "-" | "x"

As before, leading and trailing spaces are stripped from
token text and analyses, and the I<TAG> component of each
I<ANALYSIS> is "greedy".

The STATUS_CODE component of each REFRIED_TOKEN encodes a
number of flags concerning which part (if any) of the
tokens compared did not match.  The general convention
is use of a '-' character to indicate that the compared
tokens matched (or at least were compatible).

=over 4

=item TOKMATCH_FLAG

'-' if token text components matched, otherwise 't'.

=item BESTMATCH_FLAG

'-' if best-tag components matched, otherwise 'b'.

=item EMPTY_FLAG

'-' if token ANALYSES were non-empty (for the given file), otherwise 'e'.

=item IMPOSSIBLE_FLAG

'-' if token ANALYSES included token BESTTAG (for the corresponding file), otherwise 'i'.

=item XIMPOSSIBLE_FLAG

'-' if token ANALYSES included token BESTTAG for the B<other> file, otherwise 'x'.

=back

An example "refried" file is:

 %% Example refried file for moot
 %% FLAGS       TOK1    TOK1TAG1 ...            /       TOK2    TOK2TAG1 ...

## XML File Formats
=pod

=head1 XML FILE FORMATS

moot currently uses the (extremely cool and amazingly fast)
Expat XML parser library by James Clark for incremental
processing of XML documents, (a previous implementation
used libxml2 (also extremely cool but not quite as amazingly fast as expat),
but the moot libxml2 support is no longer maintained, and is disabled
by default), as well as output recoding
using librecode by FranE<231>ois Pinard.  Both expat and
librecode support are compile-time options -- check
the contents of 'mootConfig.h' to see whether they
are enabled on your system.

When working with "cooked" XML (see below), it is
critical to remember that the moot internal processing
routines B<always> receive token and PoS-tag text encoded
in UTF-8, I<regardless> of the document encoding.
This is of particular importance when converting
from native to XML format i.e. with 'mootchurn'
-- it is highly reccommended that you use the 'recode'
command-line utility (distributed with 'librecode')
to ensure that your native text data
is true UTF-8 before passing it to 'mootchurn' for XML
output.

Similarly, HMM model data (see L<HMM MODEL FILE FORMATS>)
B<must> be UTF-8 encoded for
tagging in XML mode.  There is currently no way to
directly convert the encoding of a binary model file,
but text model files can be converted with the 'recode'
command-line utility.

Future implementations might use locale
information to (partially) automate the recoding process.
If all of your data (training corpus, test corpus,
and runtime corpora) are parsed in XML mode,
none of the above should present a problem.

XML files are identified by the filename infix '.xml'.

## Input : XML : Cooked
=pod

=head2 Cooked XML Files

As of version 2.0.0, the moot utilities
support "cooked" XML files, in addition to the native
text format(s).  See "Cooked Text Files" above for
more details on the native formats and the
information content corresponding to the various
subtypes.

All "cooked" XML formats share the same structure (much
as the "cooked" text formats are defined in terms of
one another).  The preliminary syntax (subject to change
without notice) is:

 COOKED_XML_FILE    ::= {XML_DECL}? {XML_CONTENT}*
 XML_DECL           ::= "<?xml " ... "?>"
 XML_CONTENT        ::= {XML_EOS} | {XML_RAW} | {XML_TOKEN}
 XML_EOS            ::= "<eos/>"
 XML_RAW            ::= ...
 XML_TOKEN          ::= "<token>" {XML_TOKEN_CONTENT} "</token>"
 XML_TOKEN_CONTENT  ::= ({XML_TOKEN_TEXT}
                         | {XML_TOKEN_ANALYSIS}
                         | {XML_TOKEN_BESTTAG}
                         | {XML_RAW})*
 XML_TOKEN_TEXT     ::= "<text>" {TOKEN_TEXT} "</text>"
 XML_TOKEN_BESTTAG  ::= "<moot.tag>" {TOKEN_BESTTAG} "</moot.tag>"
 XML_TOKEN_ANALYSIS ::= '<analysis pos="' {ANALYSIS_TAG} '">' {ANALYSIS_DETAILS} "</analysis>"
 ANALYSIS_DETAILS   ::= {XML_RAW}*

The document structure is thus expected to be something like
the following (in a bastard notation born of BNF and XPath):

 SENTENCE_BOUNDARY  ::= //eos                            # really only end-elts
 TOKEN_TEXT         ::= //token//text/text()             # should be accurate
 ANALYIS_TAG        ::= //token//analysis/@pos           # uses attribute value (not full node)
 ANALYSIS_DETAILS   ::= //token//analysis/text()         # buggy -- actually ignored!
 TOKEN_BESTTAG      ::= //token//moot.tag[last()]/text() # should be accurate

## Input : I/O Format Flags
=pod

=head2 I/O Format Flags

Several moot utilities are capable of processing input
in a number of different formats, typically specified
by '--input-format' (-I) and '--output-format' (-O) command-line options
The following list briefly describes the (case-insensitive)
format flags which may occur as individual elements of the
comma-separated list passed as an argument to these format options.
Each format flag may be preceeded by an exclamation point "!" to indicate
the negation of the respective format property.
Note that at the current time, not all formats support
all available flags.

If no format flags are specified by the user, the
moot utilities will attempt to guess an appropriate
format based on the filename and on the requirements
for the particular utility in question.

=over 4

=item Basic Flags

=over 4

=item None

No flags at all.
This should never really happen at runtime,
and should cause a default format to be assumed
and/or an appropriate format to be guessed from
the relevant filename(s).

=item Null

If you specify 'null' as an output format,
no output will actually be written
(useful for testing and benchmarking the input layer).

=item Unknown

Unknown format.
This should never ever happen,
and should cause a reversion to some default format.

=item Native

Specifies native text format I/O, as opposed to XML.

=item XML

Specifies XML format I/O, as opposed to a native text format.

=item Pretty

Beautified XML format.
Useful for human-readable XML output.
Not all XML I/O modes support cosmetic surgery.

=item Conserve

Conservative XML format: attempt to preserve as
much of the input document structure as possible.
Only meaningful if both XML input and XML output
are requested.

=item Text

Read/write token text (all formats).

=item Analyzed

Read/write token analyses ('medium rare' or 'well done' formats only).

=item Tagged

Read/write 'best tags' ('medium' or 'well done' formats only).

=item Location

Read/write token locations as logical pairs (BYTE_OFFSET,BYTE_LENGTH)
from/to the input stream as the first non-tag analysis.
Useful if you need to refer back to earlier stages of a token processing pipeline.

=item Cost

Read/write analysis "costs" from/to analysis "E<lt>I<NUMBER>E<gt>" suffixes.
This flag may be set by default in future versions.

=item Trace

If set as an output format flag, causes a verbose dump of the Viterbi trellis
to be spliced into every tagged sentence as post-token comments.  Does nothing
as an input flag (yet).

=item Pruned

For 'well done' formats, ignore analyses which do
not correspond to the 'best' tag.

## HMM Model File Formats

=head1 HMM MODEL FILE FORMATS

The moothmm(1) program can use either text- or native
binary-format model files, which encode raw frequency counts
(text model files), or probability tables and compile-time

##--------------------------------------------------------------
## HMM Models: Text
=pod

=head2 Text Models

A "Text Model" is completely specified by
three files: a lexical freqency file (*.lex), an n-gram frequency
file (*.123), and an optional lexical-class frequency file (*.clx).

When specifiying a text model name to a moot utility program,
you may specify the model name as I<TMODEL> in order to use the
files I<TMODEL>.lex , I<TMODEL>.123 , and I<TMODEL>.clx (if present).
Otherwise, you may specifiy a composite model name as
a comma-separated list of the individual component filenames:
F<mylex.lex,myngrams.123,myclasses.clx>.

=over 4

=cut

##--------------------------------------------------------------
## HMM Models: Text: Lexical Frequencies
=pod

=item B<Lexical Frequency Files>

Lexical frequency files store raw frequencies for known tokens
and (token,tag) pairs.  The format use is ca. 99.998% compatible
with that generated by the tnt-para(1) program:

 LEX_FILE    ::= ({COMMENT} | {BLANK_LINE} | {LEX_ENTRY})*
 COMMENT     ::= {SPACE}* "%%" ([^{NEWLINE}])*  {NEWLINE}
 BLANK_LINE  ::= {SPACE}* {NEWLINE}
 LEX_ENTRY   ::= {TOKEN_TEXT} {TAB} {TOKEN_TOTAL} ( {TAB} {TAG_COUNT} )*
 TAG_COUNT   ::= {TAG_TEXT} {TAB} {TOK_TAG_CT}
 TOKEN_TOTAL ::= {COUNT}
 TOK_TAG_CT  ::= {COUNT}
 TOKEN_TEXT  ::= {STRING} | {SPECIAL_TOK}
 TAG_TEXT    ::= {STRING}
 STRING      ::= ( [^{TAB}{NEWLINE}] )+
 COUNT       ::=  ("-"|"+")? ([0-9]* ".")? [0-9]+
 NEWLINE     ::= "\n" | "\r"
 TAB         ::= "\t"
 SPECIAL_TOK ::= "@UNKNOWN"
                 | "@CARD"
                 | "@CARDSEPS"
                 | "@CARDPUNCT"
                 | "@CARDSUFFIX"

Leading and trailing spaces are stripped from token
and tag text.

The special tokens whose text begins with an '@' character
declare counts for special token types:

=over 4

=item * @UNKNOWN

Declares frequency counts to be used when no other training
data is available (i.e. for alphabetic tokens which did not occur in the
training corpus).

=item * @CARD

Declares frequency counts to be used for tokens consisting
only of digits -- tokens which match the regex:

 [0-9]+

=item * @CARDSEPS

Declares frequency counts to be used for tokens which
contain digits and separators.  The regex matching
such tokens is (?):

 ([[:digit:]]+)([\.\,\-]|[[:digit:]])*

=item * @CARDPUNCT

Declares frequency counts to be used for tokens which
contain digits followed by punctuation.
The regex matching such tokens is (?):

 ([[:digit:]]+)([[:punct:]])

=item * @CARDSUFFIX

Declares frequency counts to be used for tokens which
contain digits followed by some suffix.
The regex matching
these tokens depends on whether the C<moot_TNT_COMPAT> macro
macro was defined when you compiled libmoot:

If C<moot_TNT_COMPAT> was defined, then the suffix
of "@CARDSUFFIX" tokens is required to be of maximum
length 3, thus matching the regex:

 ([[:digit:]]+)(.{1,3})

Otherwise, the suffix for "@CARDSUFFIX" tokens may
be of arbitrary length:

 ([[:digit:]]+)(.*)

## HMM Text-Models: Ngram Frequency Files
=pod

=item B<Ngram Frequency Files>

An n-gram frequency file stores raw frequency counts for
uni-, bi-, and tri-grams.  An n-gram file may be in either
"long" or "short" format, both of which are compatible
with the respective formats produced by the tnt-para(1)
program:

 NGRAM_FILE  ::= ({COMMENT} | {BLANK_LINE} | {NGRAM_ENTRY})*
 COMMENT     ::= {SPACE}* "%%" ([^{NEWLINE}])*  {NEWLINE}
 BLANK_LINE  ::= {SPACE}* {NEWLINE}
 NGRAM_ENTRY ::= {UNIGRAM} | {BIGRAM} | {TRIGRAM}
 UNIGRAM     ::= {TAG} {TAB} {COUNT}
 BIGRAM      ::= {TAG} {TAB} {TAG} {TAB} {COUNT}
 TRIGRAM     ::= {TAG} {TAB} {TAG} {TAB} {TAG} {TAB} {COUNT}
 TAG         ::= EOS_TAG | ( [^{TAB}{NEWLINE}] )*
 EOS_TAG     ::= "__$"
 COUNT       ::=  ("-"|"+")? ([0-9]* ".")? [0-9]+
 NEWLINE     ::= "\n" | "\r"
 TAB         ::= "\t"

Leading and trailing spaces are stripped from tags.
An empty I<TAG> component is populated with the tag
in the corresponding position from the last n-gram
parsed -- exhaustive use of this feature produces
"short" format n-gram files.  Non-use of this feature
produces "long" format n-gram files.

An example "long" format n-gram file is:

 %% Example n-gram frequency file in "long" format

## HMM Text-Models: Lexical-Class Frequency Files
=pod

=item B<Lexical-Class Frequency Files>

Lexical-class frequency files store raw frequencies for known
lexical classes (read "sets of possible part-of-speech tags")
and (class,tag) pairs.  The format is a direct extension
of the format for lexical frequency files
(see "Lexical Frequency Files", above):

 CLASS_FILE  ::= ({COMMENT} | {BLANK_LINE} | {CLASS_ENTRY})*
 CLASS_ENTRY ::= {CLASS_ELTS} {TAB} {CLASS_TOTAL} ( {TAB} {TAG_COUNT} )*
 CLASS_ELTS  ::= ( {CLASS_TAG} {SPACE} )*
 CLASS_TAG   ::= ( [^{SPACE}{TAB}{NEWLINE}] )+

As for lexical frequency files, leading and trailing whitespaces
are stripped from class and tag text.

The I<CLASS_ELTS> component specifies a (space-separated) list
of tags belonging to the lexical class.  All other (tab-separated)
fields are as for a lexical frequency file.

A pair (CLASS,TAG) such that TAG is not an element of CLASS
is called an "contradictory pair" or an "impossible pair".
It is not required that the the tags in the I<TAG_COUNT>
components of a I<CLASS_ENTRY> are "possible" in this sense,
although it certainly helps if this is the case.

An example lexical class frequency file is:

 %% Example lexical frequency file
 PDAT NE        4       PDAT    4
 VVFIN VAFIN    1.0     VVFIN   0.7     VAFIN   0.3

## HMM Binary Model Files
=pod

=head2 HMM Binary Model Files

A "Binary Model" I<BINMODEL> is a (compressed) binary format
file storing a compiled Hidden Markov Model (probabilities
and constants).  It is completely
specified by its filename F<BINMODEL>.
By convention, HMM binary model files carry the suffix
".hmm".

When specifying an HMM model file,
note that the existence of a file F<BINMODEL> overrides
any text models which might exists in files
I<BINMODEL>.lex , I<BINMODEL>.123 , I<BINMODEL>.clx.
Use of a conventional suffix (such as ".hmm") to identify binary models
eliminates such problems, since I<MODEL>.hmm will B<not> clash
with a text model I<MODEL>.lex, ...

An HMM dump is a plain text file containing all the
