at the Berlin-Brandenburgische Akademie der Wissenschaften.

The authors are grateful to Christiane Fellbaum, Alexander Geyken,
Gerald Neumann, Edmund Pohl, Alexey Sokirko, and others

Thomas Hanneforth wrote and maintains the libFSM C++ library
for finite-state device operations used by the
class-based HMM tagger / disambiguator, without which
moot could not have been built.
Alexander Geyken and Thomas Hanneforth developed the
rule-based morphological analysis system for German

class-based HMM tagger / disambiguator.
