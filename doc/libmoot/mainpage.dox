\mainpage libmoot: moot PoS tagging library

\author Bryan Jurish <moocow@cpan.org>

\version 2.0.14


\section Intro Introduction

libmoot is a C++ library for Part-of-Speech (PoS) tagging.
In addition to traditional bigram tagging routines, libmoot
allows the use of user-specified a priori sets of possible analyses
for each input token ("lexical classes"), which has been shown
to lead to a reduction in errors of up to 32% with respect
to traditional Hidden-Markov-Model (HMM) methods.


\section PP Preprocessing

libmoot includes a rudimentary preprocessor for raw text,
which tokenizes an input stream, and eliminates most SGML
markup.

\section HMM HMM Tagging

The \link moot::mootHMM mootHMM\endlink class provides
an implementation of a traditional HMM tagging and disambiguation,
optionally extended by lexical-class probabilities, which can be
helpful if you have some prior information on what sorts of
tags your input tokens might in fact happen to carry.

\section Eval Tagger Evaluation

The \link moot::mootEval mootEval\endlink class provides
an API for (cross-)evaluation of parallel tagged files,
optionally extended by prior analyses.

\section IO Extendible I/O

The high-level
\link mootTokenIO.h mootTokenIO\endlink
layer
comprises the \link moot::TokenReader TokenReader\endlink 
and \link moot::TokenWriter TokenWriter\endlink
classes, which provide an abstract API specification for
definition of user-defined I/O protocols using
the C++ virtual method convention.  Builtin
Token specializations include classes for
native text-format and XML I/O.

The low-level \link mootio mootio\endlink abstraction
layer provides wrappers for several common stream
flavors, including C streams (FILE*s), C++ streams,
C memory buffers (char*s), as well as zlib compressed
file streams (gzFile).

I am grateful to Christiane Fellbaum, Alexander Geyken,
Thomas Hanneforth, Gerald Neumann, Edmund Pohl, Alexey Sokirko, and others
for offering useful insights in the course of development
of this package.

Thomas Hanneforth wrote and maintains the libFSM C++ library
for finite-state device operations used in the development
of the class-based HMM tagger / disambiguator.

Alexander Geyken and Thomas Hanneforth developed the
rule-based morphological analysis system for German
which was used in the development and testing of the
class-based HMM tagger / disambiguator.
