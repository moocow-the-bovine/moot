Issue the following commands to the shell:

 sh ./configure
 make
 make install

See the file INSTALL in the top-level distribution
directory for details.

aclocal, automake, autoconf, and libtool.  If
you have these, you can just run the top-level
script:

 sh ./autogen.sh

This will create the 'configure' script and other
necessary build files.

You will also need the Getopt::Gen perl module,
which should be available from wherever you acquired
these sources.

Morphology is still quite slow.

No distribution site.

No HMM trainer (use tnt-para(1)).
