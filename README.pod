Issue the following commands to the shell:

 sh ./configure
 make
 make install

See the file INSTALL in the top-level distribution
directory for details.

=head1 BUILD FROM CVS

To build from CVS, you need the GNU utilities
aclocal, automake, autoconf, and libtool.  If
you have these, you can just run the top-level

 sh ./autogen.sh

which should be available from wherever you acquired
these sources.

No config-file parsing.

Horribly inaccurate.

Too slow.

No distribution site.

Many, many more.
