moot (2.0.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * re-added & tested binary model I/O
  * added new 'mootcompile' and 'mootdump' programs
    to clean up 'moot' itself a bit
  * moved old 'programs/cmdutil.*' and 'programs/hmmutil.*'
    structs and functions into library: 'mootUtils.h';
    redefined in terms of 'string'

  * gaspode bughunt
	  - re-added 'uclass' item and threshhold-sensitive
	    uclass compiling (need a populated class for iteration);
	    gained a smidgeon of accuracy:
	    * 94.91% (-classfreqs,-analyses)
	    * 96.30% (-classfreqs,+analyses)
	    * 96.52% (+classfreqs,+analyses)
	  - best results (read: "the above") come (intuitively)
	    when using class-probabilities for totally unknown
	    tokens (i.e. the probabilities associated with
	    the empty class)
  * added mootHMM flag 'use_lex_classes' : things go way
	  wrong tagging classless inputs if we try and use
	  class probabilities (well, duh...)
  * removed some debugging code in mootHMM.(h|cc)
	
	+ renamed 'moothmm' -> 'moot'
	+ added perl script 'morphhack.perl' to make
	  (old) morph output more negra-compatible
	  - raises accuracy on test corpus to
	    * 94.91% (-classfreqs,-analyses)
	    * 96.12% (-classfreqs,+analyses)
	    * 96.51% (+classfreqs,+analyses)
	
  * added class 'mootEval'
  * added evaluator program 'mooteval' - better than tnt-diff
  * added verbose information tracking to HMM

  * added mootToken.h: mootToken, mootSentence interface classes
  	  - old string-based methods now deprecated
  * added mootTokenLexer - replaces old 'mootTaggerLexer'
	  - parses new MorphConsole output (with TAB separators, at least)
  * added mootTokenIO.h : classes mootToken(Reader|Writer)
	  - for file and/or string I/O in native format(s)
  * (re-)added 'best-only' output as option to moothmm
  * added best-tag marking with prefix '/' (and removed it again)
  * fixed some smallish bugs in 'mootrain' causing
	  segfaults when:
	  - "--ngrams-only" or "--lex-only" were given
	  - training corpus filename contained no dot
  * re-wrote mootNgrams, mootLexfreqs
	  - use nested maps for data: faster
  * re-wrote mootHMMTrainer
	  - (kmax=3) now hard-coded in (use uni-, bi-, and trigrams)
	  - training from ambiguous data no longer possible
  * fixed token-typification code (now in mootToken.h)
	  - should now be ca. 99.998% TnT-compatible with moot_TNT_COMPAT
	    macro defined (can't find the last bugger)
	  - Today's Most Annoying Undocumented Feature Award goes to
	    Thorsten Brants for failing to document TnT's (length<=3)
	    restriction for @CARDSUFFIX types
  * reduced old mootCHMM to mootHMM (still untested)
  * added class mootClassfreqs : raw class frequency counter (untested)
  * added mootClassfreqs(Lexer|Parser|Compiler) for
	  lexical-class parameter text I/O
  * added section 5 manpage 'mootfiles' documenting various
	  file formats
  * added class-counting to mootHMMTrainer (tests ok)
  * added class compilation to mootHMM (tests ok)
	  - old mootHMM behavior can be emulated by achieved
	    by removing .clx (class-frequency) file
  * CHMM behavior reduced to HMM tests OK (good ol' 95.67% correct)
	  - weirdness: gaspode class fixes bungled... must investigate

moot (1.0.5) unstable; urgency=low

moot (1.0.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * renamed to "moot" from "dwdst".
  * added additional detection routines for libFSM >= v0.1.1.1
  * added --disable-fsm flag to ./configure
  * added placebo classes methods in src/libmoot/mootFSM.h
	- now compiles without libFSM: nothing much interesting works,
	  but at least it compiles...
