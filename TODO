  + mootTokenLexer: re-integrate analysis COST parsing a la FSM
    - Idea (token regex):
      TEXT (SIMPLE_TAG | (PRE_DETAILS? "[" TAG)) POST_DETAILS? ("<"COST">")?
    - must also pull this through to:
      ~ class mootToken (add a property)
      ~ other I/O classes (XML, *Writer)
    - check with Micha Brandt re: compatibility
