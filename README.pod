=head1 REQUIREMENTS

=over 4


=item pkg-config (Required)

Available from:
http://www.freedesktop.org/software/pkgconfig/

To build from cvs, you will also need the pkg-config
autoconf macros which come with the source distribution
of pkg-config.


=item STL headers (Required)

If your C++ compiler does not have the STL
headers already installed, you will need
to get them from somewhere.
For gcc-2.x, I recommend STLport E<gt>= 4.5.3,
available from http://www.stlport.org
You will have to set the environment variables
CPPFLAGS, LDFLAGS, and LIBS according to
your installation before building.


=item flex++ , bison++ (Optional)

Alain Coetmeur's C++ ports of the famous lexer/parser
generator pair, available from:
ftp://iecc.com/pub/file/bison++flex++
or
from the official distribution site of this package.

Tested with flex++-v2.3.8-4 and bison++-v1.21-5.

Should only be required if you want/need to mess with
the native I/O formats.

available from
http://expat.sourceforge.net

=head1 INSTALLATION

Issue the following commands to the shell:

 sh ./configure
 make
 make install

See the file INSTALL in the top-level distribution
directory for details.

=head1 BUILD FROM CVS

To build from CVS, you need the GNU utilities
aclocal, automake, autoconf, and libtool.  If
you have these, you can just run the top-level
script:

 sh ./autogen.sh

This will create the 'configure' script and other
necessary build files.

You will also need Perl and the Getopt::Gen Perl module,
which should be available from wherever you acquired
these sources.
