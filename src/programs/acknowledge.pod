This package was developed in the context of the
project 'Kollokationen im Wörterbuch'
("collocations in the dictionary", http://www.bbaw.de/forschung/kollokationen)
in association with the project
'Digitales Wörterbuch deutscher Sprache (DWDS)'
("digital dictionary of the German language", http://www.dwds.de)
at the Berlin-Brandenburgische Akademie der Wissenschaften (http://www.bbaw.de)
with funding from
the Alexander von Humboldt Stiftung (http://www.avh.org)
and from the Zukunftsinvestitionsprogramm of the
German federal government.

I am grateful to Christiane Fellbaum, Alexander Geyken,
Gerald Neumann, Edmund Pohl, Alexey Sokirko, and others
for offering useful insights in the course of development
of this package.

Thomas Hanneforth wrote and maintains the libFSM C++ library
for finite-state device operations used by the
class-based HMM tagger / disambiguator.

Alexander Geyken and Thomas Hanneforth developed the
rule-based morphological analysis system for German
which was used in the development and testing of the
class-based HMM tagger / disambiguator.
